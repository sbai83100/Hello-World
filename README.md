# Hello, World!

Hi! My name is Sam Bai. I am currently a student at the University of Maryland, College Park, pursuing a bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Data Science and potentially Statistics.

I started programming in high school, with Java being my first language. Since then, I have taken courses that have allowed me to also learn C and C++. However, to further expand my database of programming languages, I have also learned Python, HTML/CSS, and SQL on the side.

This summer, I am immersing myself more in artificial intelligence by auditing Harvard University CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python. You can see those projects here on my GitHub profile.
